Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, and was created by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger.[14] Sanger coined its name[15][16] as a portmanteau of the words "wiki" (Hawaiian for "quick")[17] and "encyclopedia". Initially an English-language encyclopedia, versions of Wikipedia in other languages were quickly developed. With 6.1 million articles, the English Wikipedia is the largest of the more than 300 Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than 53 million articles[18] attracting 1.5 billion unique visitors per month.[19][20]
