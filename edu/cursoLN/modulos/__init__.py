      If you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the definitions you have made
     (functions and variables) are lost. Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program,
      you are better off using a text editor to prepare the input for the interpreter and running it
      with that file as input instead. This is known as creating a script. As your program gets longer,
      you may want to split it into several files for easier maintenance.

      You may also want to use a handy function that youâ€™ve written in several programs without
      copying its definition into each program.

      To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in
      an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file is called a module; definitions from a
       module can be imported into other modules or into the main module (the collection of variables
       that you have access to in a script executed at the top level and in calculator mode).

       A module allows you to logically organize your Python code. Grouping related code into a module
       makes the code easier to understand and use. A module is a Python object with arbitrarily named
       attributes that you can bind and reference.

       Simply, a module is a file consisting of Python code. A module can define functions, classes
       and variables. A module can also include runnable code.
