    Python has implicit support for Data Structures which enable you to store and access data.
    These structures are called List, Dictionary, Tuple and Set.
     Python allows its users to create their own Data Structures enabling them to have full control over their functionality

    What is a Data Structure?

    Organizing, managing and storing data is important as it enables easier access and efficient modifications.
     Data Structures allows you to organize your data in such a way that enables you to store collections of
     data, relate them and perform operations on them accordingly.

     Types of Data Structures in Python

     The most prominent Data Structures are Stack, Queue, Tree, Linked List and so on which are also available to you
     in other programming languages. So now that you know what are the types available to you, why donâ€™t we move ahead
     to the Data Structures and implement them using Python.
