Wikipedians often have disputes regarding content, which may result in repeatedly making opposite changes to an article, known as "edit warring".[98][99] The process is a resource-consuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added.[100] This practice is also criticized as creating a competitive,[101] conflict based[102] editing culture associated with traditional masculine gender roles,[103] which contributes to the gender bias on Wikipedia.
